## Problem Description:
Our Course Registration Management System is designed to streamline the course enrollment process and enhance administrative efficiency in universities. This system facilitates key functions such as course scheduling, student enrollment, instructor assignments, and academic progress tracking. By centralizing data, our system minimizes scheduling conflicts, optimizes resource allocation, and ensures students have access to the courses they need. Additionally, it provides administrators with real-time insights into enrollment trends, faculty workload, and resource utilization, enabling data-driven decision-making. Ultimately, the Course Registration Management System supports the universityâ€™s mission of fostering academic success while improving operational efficiency and institutional growth.

## Data Model:

## Data Dictionary:

## Queries:
#### Query 1: Identifying Courses with Low Averages
#####Question: Which courses have a class average of 75 or less and who is their course instructor?

This query helps identify courses where students may be struggling academically and can indicate issues such as challenging course material, ineffective teaching methods, or need for additional support. It provides two key insights: instructional Effectiveness and curriculum challenges. If multiple courses taught by the same instructor have low averages, it may indicate a need for teaching adjustments or additional support. On the other hand, some courses may have outdated or overly difficult content, requiring curriculum updates or extra resources like tutoring. Identifying struggling courses early allows schools to take proactive steps and work toward improving student success and course quality.
