## Problem Description:
Our Course Registration Management System is designed to streamline the course enrollment process and enhance administrative efficiency in universities. This system facilitates key functions such as course scheduling, student enrollment, instructor assignments, and academic progress tracking. By centralizing data, our system minimizes scheduling conflicts, optimizes resource allocation, and ensures students have access to the courses they need. Additionally, it provides administrators with real-time insights into enrollment trends, faculty workload, and resource utilization, enabling data-driven decision-making. Ultimately, the Course Registration Management System supports the university’s mission of fostering academic success while improving operational efficiency and institutional growth.

## Data Model:

This data model showcases a university’s course registration system, including students, instructors, courses, enrollments, and grades. The Student entity is linked to the Enrollment entity, allowing for the tracking of student participation in various courses and maintaining academic records. The Instructor entity connects to the Course entity, ensuring that each course is assigned to a faculty member. Course details, such as course name, description, credits, and department, are stored within the Course entity, which helps manage academic offerings. Enrollment data is captured through the Enrollment entity, which records details like student ID, course CRN, and enrollment date, ensuring proper tracking of course registration. Lastly, the Grade entity connects to Enrollment, allowing for the recording of student performance, including letter grades, GPA equivalents, and grading dates. The relationships between these entities ensure comprehensive data storage for managing university operations, from course scheduling and faculty assignments to student progress tracking.  

The Student entity serves as the foundation of the data model. It stores key student information such as first name, last name, email, major, and enrollment date. The Student and Course entities share a many-to-many relationship, as each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students. To properly represent this relationship, the Enrollment entity serves as the linking table, connecting students to the courses they register for. This joint table between Student and Course, forms a one-to-many relationship where a student can enroll in multiple courses, but each enrollment record belongs to only one student.  

The Instructor entity has a one-to-many relationship with the Course entity, as an instructor can teach multiple courses, but each course is assigned to only one instructor. The Enrollment entity also connects to the Course entity in a one-to-many relationship, ensuring that multiple students can enroll in a single course while maintaining an accurate record of enrollment history.  

When it comes to the Grade entity, it is connected to the Enrollment entity through a one-to-one relationship. Each enrollment record has a corresponding grade entry, tracking a student's performance in a specific course. The Grade entity ensures accurate academic tracking and helps in generating transcripts and GPA calculations.  

Finally, the relationships between these entities ensure a well-structured course registration system, allowing universities to efficiently manage student enrollments, faculty assignments, and academic progress while maintaining a streamlined and organized database.
